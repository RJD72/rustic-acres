He is a healthy and happy little guy and a perfect addition to our family. Mike and Angie were lovely to deal with and clearly have a love for the breed. We met our pup at their home and got to meet the dog mother and her dog sister as well as the other pups. Our little guy is everything we could have hoped: smart, loving, cuddly, loyal, confident, curious, eager to learn, and loves to nap on the couch with you, play, or go out for a long walk.

Fast forward to 2025, we now have 2 female Cavalier’s that we got from Mike. Both of our girls are in great health since day one. To quote our vet, they are the “picture of perfect health” and the “epitome of the breed.” The girls have great tempers, they are sociable with all types of pets and people. They are not just loving lap dogs, they enjoy long hikes and are super smart and eager to learn new tricks. So perfect for a variety of lifestyles. We’ve also moved across Ontario, and traveling with the two of them was seamless, they are extremely adaptable. Not to mention we constantly get stopped and asked about how we got them. In regards to our experience with Mike, we could not have had a better experience with a breeder! He communicated with us constantly, giving us updates on our dogs and when they would be ready to join our family. He’s always available to answer any question and is very transparent with his clients. In fact when we are ready to add another member of the family, we will be contacting Mike again as he truly cares about his animals and clients.
